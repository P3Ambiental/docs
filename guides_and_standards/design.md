# General

* I realise we are working on different platforms and there will be differences espcailly on colours on different devices. We do need to be aware of each others work. So that the look and feel of the apps are not vastly different (I have often seen this).

# Binit Colours

* Background - #b1daaf
* Dark Green - #4eab47
* (The above colours are the P3 Ambiental Corporate colours)

* Logo Green - #0e9246

# Corporate Image
* The main Binit logo or the smaller Binit "B" should appear on all pages.

# Font

* Futura

# Other Guidelines

* Implement excatly what is shown in the mockups. If you want to change something or add something, let us know. 
* Make things big - Text entry fields, buttons, etc.
* Make things with ease of touch, reading, and navigation in mind.

## Form Fields

* Give them rounded corners. These should have the same radius as the buttons.
* A field should take up 80% of screen width.
* The height of the fields needs to be larger. Firstly so that the content is easy to read and secondly as they should not just look like normal form fields. They should be standardised across the app. i.e. the same on each page.
