# General

* We are working on different platforms and there will, of course, be differences especially in the colours when viewed on different devices. We do, however, need to be aware of each other's work. So that the look and feel of the apps are not vastly different.

# Binit Colours

* Background - #b1daaf
* Dark Green - #4eab47
* (The above colours are the P3 Ambiental Corporate colours)

* Logo Green - #0e9246

# Corporate Image
* The main Binit logo or the smaller Binit "B" should appear on all pages.

# Graphics

* We should minimise the use of graphic elements in the app. Obviously, items such as logos will need to be a graphic. Where possible use fonts as indicated below. For icons, we will be using fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/) and for all other graphics please use CSS, XML, HTML. 

# Font Awesome

* Some font awesome icon codes that can be used to replace the graphic assets.
* Add a point - plus-circle
* Search - search
* Group - users
* User - user-circle
* Settings - cog
* Message - envelope
* Email - at
* Tree - tree
* Building - building
* Information - info-circle
* Camera - camera
* Edit - pencil-alt
* Trashcan - trash-alt
* View - eye
* Facebook - facebook-square
* Google Plus - google-plus-square
* Twitter - twitter-square
* Instagram - instagram
* Youtube - youtube-square
* Thumbs up - thumbs-up


# Fonts

* Futura
* Javacom (The Rubbish App) https://www.dafont.com/javacom.font
* Noteworthy Light (Be the Solution!) http://www.cufonfonts.com/en/font/14469/noteworthy

# Other Guidelines

* Implement as close as possible to what is shown in the mockups. If you want to change something or add something, let us know. 
* Make things big - Text entry fields, buttons, etc.
* Make things with ease of touch, reading, and navigation in mind.

# Form Fields

* Give them rounded corners. These should have the same radius as the buttons.
* A field should take up 80% of screen width.
* The height of the fields needs to be larger than normal. Firstly so that the content is easy to read and secondly as they should not just look like normal form fields. They should be standardised across the app. i.e. the same on each page.

# Completed Page Layouts

* When you feel that the page you have been working on is finished, or if you are unsure about the design, direct message to @jules in the Binit Slack Workspace.

# Other

* If you need anything else to do with the design ping @jules in the #design channel and start a discussion there.
